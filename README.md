# CIOOS Metadata Profile

The CIOOS metadata profile is based on the ISO 19115 standard [https://www.iso.org/standard/53798.html], with some customizations including additional mandatory and recommended elements that go beyond the core ISO requirements, as well as the addition of some bilingual requirements (for title, abstract, and some keywords).

CIOOS has developed a metadata entry form that conforms to our standard and allows for simplified harvesting of dataset metadata into the CIOOS platform:
https://cioos-siooc.github.io/metadata-entry-form/#/en/region-select

The most up to date source of information about the profile is currently found in the guidance provided in the metadata entry form itself. The CIOOS metadata task team will be making periodic updates to the profile that will also be reflected in our metadata form. 

## Additional Documentation

Some documentation of the profile was created for the odler version 1 of the profile (CIOOS has since released version 2):

This documentation is currently rendered here:

Further documentation of the profile is also planned for the CIOOS wiki:
